# Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
Welcome to the Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation Calculator! This project is a Python-based calculator designed to compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset. It performs basic statistical calculations and outputs the results in an easy-to-understand format.

Features
Calculate Mean: Computes the arithmetic mean (average) of the input data.
Compute Variance: Measures the spread of the data points from the mean.
Standard Deviation: Provides a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
Flexible Input: Supports arrays of numbers as input for calculations.
Pythonic Design: Built using Python, making it easy to extend or modify.
# Installation
To run the calculator locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/KingTroy125/Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
cd Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install required dependencies (if any):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python script:

bash
python calculator.py
Usage
Once the script is running, provide a list of numbers as input to calculate the following:

Mean
Variance
Standard Deviation
You can modify the input dataset inside the calculator.py file or pass it as a command-line argument if supported.

# Example:

python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The primary language for implementing the calculator.
NumPy (optional): If the project uses this library for efficient number manipulation.
